# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ˜„

Contributions are handled in the form of Pull Requests. You fork this repository, create a new branch, make relevant changes, and submit a Pull Request â€“ once that's done we'll be able to review your PRs and merge them to the master branch.

## How to contribute

Suggestions for improvements
Â 
> If you use the project and think it would be interesting to add some functionality; something useful in the project, so you can enter the issues and leave your suggestion there too.

Bugs in the documentation

> It may be identifying a semantic, logical error or even if the examples in this documentation do not work. The documentation may be out of date or something. Correct and send the Pull Request.

Bugs in the code

> If you don't know the language, then you can test it anyway and send an Issue to be corrected.

## Formatting

Format your PR titles likewise:

> [Tag]: Describe change in present tense

Tag can be:

- Feat (new feature)
- Fix (bug fix)
- Refactor (refactoring code)
- Style (formatting, no code change)
- Doc (changes to documentation)
- Test (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
